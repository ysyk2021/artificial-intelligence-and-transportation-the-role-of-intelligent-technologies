To fully understand the role that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play in transportation planning and design, it is important to have an understanding of the current transportation landscape. In this chapter, we will explore global trends in transportation planning and design, as well as the components of transportation systems.

Global Trends in Transportation Planning and Design
---------------------------------------------------

### Urbanization

One of the major global trends in transportation is increasing urbanization. As more and more people move into cities, there is an increasing need for efficient and sustainable transportation systems that can reduce congestion and pollution.

### Sustainability

Sustainability is another major trend in transportation planning and design. Governments and organizations are investing in sustainable transportation modes, such as public transit, cycling, and walking, as a way to reduce emissions and promote healthy living.

### Digitalization

Digitalization is another trend in transportation, with the increasing use of technology and data to improve transportation systems. This includes the use of real-time traffic data, intelligent transportation systems, and mobile apps to improve transportation efficiency and convenience.

### Multi-Modal Transportation

Multi-modal transportation refers to the use of multiple transportation modes, such as public transit, cycling, and walking, to complete a single journey. This approach can lead to more efficient and sustainable transportation systems.

Components of Transportation Systems
------------------------------------

### Infrastructure

Infrastructure refers to the physical components of transportation systems, such as roads, highways, bridges, and tunnels. The design and quality of infrastructure can have a significant impact on the efficiency and safety of transportation systems.

### Vehicles

Vehicles refer to the modes of transportation used to move people or goods, such as cars, buses, trains, and planes. The type and design of vehicles can impact the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of transportation systems.

### Operations

Operations refer to the management and coordination of transportation systems, including traffic management, scheduling and dispatching, and maintenance. Effective operations can improve the efficiency and safety of transportation systems.

### Users

Users refer to the people who use transportation systems, including drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. It is important to understand user behavior and preferences in order to design effective transportation systems.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, the current transportation landscape is characterized by global trends such as urbanization, sustainability, digitalization, and multi-modal transportation. The components of transportation systems include infrastructure, vehicles, operations, and users. By understanding these trends and components, we can better understand the role that AI can play in improving transportation planning and design.
