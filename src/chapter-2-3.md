Machine learning is a key technique in artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of machine learning techniques.

Supervised Learning
-------------------

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the computer is given a set of labeled training data with both input and output values. The computer uses this data to build a model that can predict output values for new input data.

Unsupervised Learning
---------------------

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the computer is given a set of unlabeled training data with only input values. The computer uses this data to discover patterns and structure in the data, without any prior knowledge of what it represents.

Reinforcement Learning
----------------------

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which the computer learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The computer uses this feedback to improve its decision-making process.

Deep Learning
-------------

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks, which are artificial systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. These networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that can learn and refine representations of data over time.

Neural Networks
---------------

Neural networks are used in many machine learning applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. They can be trained using various techniques, such as backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, to optimize their performance.

Conclusion
----------

Machine learning techniques are essential to the development of artificial intelligence applications in transportation planning and design. These include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and neural networks. By understanding the fundamentals of these techniques, transportation planners and designers can leverage the power of AI to create more efficient, sustainable, and user-friendly transportation systems for communities around the world.
