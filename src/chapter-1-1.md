Overview of Artificial Intelligence and Transportation
===============================================================================

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform transportation in significant ways. By developing intelligent technologies, transportation systems can become more efficient, sustainable, and user-friendly. This book aims to explore the role of AI in transportation planning and design.

The Importance of Transportation
--------------------------------

Transportation is a vital component of modern society, enabling people and goods to move efficiently and effectively. However, transportation systems are also a major contributor to environmental pollution and are often associated with traffic congestion and other problems.

The Promise of Artificial Intelligence
--------------------------------------

AI has the potential to address some of the challenges facing transportation by enabling more efficient and sustainable systems. For example, AI can be used to optimize traffic flow, reduce carbon emissions, and improve safety.

Conclusion
----------

As AI continues to evolve and mature, it is becoming an increasingly important tool for transportation professionals who are looking to optimize the efficiency, sustainability, and user-friendliness of their systems. We hope that this book will provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in AI for transportation planning and design and stimulate discussion and inspire further research in this exciting and rapidly evolving area of technology.
