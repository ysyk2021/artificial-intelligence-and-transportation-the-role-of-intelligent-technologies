While artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in transportation planning and design, there are also several challenges and limitations associated with its use. In this chapter, we will explore some of these challenges and limitations.

Limited Data Availability
-------------------------

AI algorithms rely heavily on data to make accurate predictions and decisions. However, in the transportation industry, there can be limited data availability in certain areas, such as in developing countries or for certain transportation modes.

Safety Concerns
---------------

The safety of AI-powered transportation systems is a major concern. Autonomous vehicles, for example, must be able to accurately detect and respond to other drivers, pedestrians, and objects on the road to prevent accidents. There is also a risk of cyber attacks that could compromise the safety of transportation systems.

Cost
----

The implementation of AI-powered transportation systems can be expensive, particularly in developing countries where resources may be limited. The cost of acquiring and maintaining the necessary hardware and software can be prohibitive for many organizations.

Public Perception
-----------------

There may also be concerns about public acceptance of AI-powered transportation systems. Some people may feel uncomfortable with the idea of autonomous vehicles or may perceive AI as a threat to employment in the transportation industry.

Ethical Considerations
----------------------

The use of AI in transportation raises ethical considerations. For example, there may be questions around liability in the event of accidents involving autonomous vehicles, and concerns about privacy and data security in personalized travel planning systems.

Conclusion
----------

While the use of AI in transportation can provide significant benefits, there are also several challenges and limitations to its implementation. These challenges include limited data availability, safety concerns, cost, public perception, and ethical considerations. By addressing these challenges and limitations, transportation planners and designers can work towards creating more efficient, sustainable, and user-friendly transportation systems that meet the needs of communities around the world.
